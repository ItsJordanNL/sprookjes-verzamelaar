# Project Description

We came up with the concept of Sprookjes Verzamelaar. This app is an innovative technological addition to the current fairytale forest. Each fairytale character in the Fairytale Forest (there are 30) receives an NFC tag that can be scanned by the Twinkeltoorts.

The Twinkeltoorts is a kind of magic wand with a ball on the end, which has been used by Efteling for years to make certain decorations interactive in other places in the park. For example, you can open a large treasure chest when you hold your Twinkeltoorts against the post next to it.

However, the Twinkeltoorts does not work in the Fairytale Forest, so we do that using our app. You can connect the Twinkeltoorts with the Fairy Tale Collector app, and then you can start scanning fairy tales. Every time you “collect” a fairy tale, it is added to your collection.

If you have a fairy tale in your collection, you can read and listen to the story of the fairy tale using the built-in dictation function. This is especially intended for children who may not yet know the story. You can also find a button at the bottom of each story page that takes you to a quiz question. If you answer this quiz question correctly, you will earn a certain number of dukaten.

If you answer this quiz question incorrectly, you will have to wait 5 minutes and then try again. This way you get to know the fairy tales even better in a playful way. When you have answered the quiz question of this fairy tale correctly, a check mark will also be added in your collection page.

Now I hear you thinking: but what can you actually do with those so-called dukaten? This allows you to buy coloring pages in the coloring pages page. On this page you can also see how many dukaten you currently have, and which coloring pages you have already purchased. When you click on such a coloring page, you will have the option to print it out at home, or you can play in the “Color by Numbers” app (especially for children who do not have a printer).

You can also enable certain filters via the settings page. This way you can indicate if you have difficulty walking. If this is the case, you can watch a video of the 3 fairy tales that are not accessible to you so that you can still see them. Of course, it has been ensured that the NFC scanning point is accessible.

If you have a different culture/religion, you can also choose to filter out certain fairy tales that go against your faith. You will not be sent to fairy tales, and you do not have to collect them to get your badge.

That brings us to the badge. This is a reward for collecting all 30 fairy tales. You will then receive a QR code that you can show at the Efteling gift shop to receive a special badge.


We use the Pretaporter Slab for titles, and Montserrat for other text.

## Advice

If you do wish to continue on this project. We recommend you to take these implementations into consideration:

- The NFC/Bluetooth functionality hasn't been made.
- There are style choices that have to be reconsidered
- Make the "dukaten" coin system back-end.
- The coloring pages and settings page have not been made.
